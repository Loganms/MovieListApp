# MovieListApp
A web application that allows you to create lists of movies you’d like to watch.  A person using the app may create a “Horror Movies” list that contains all the horror movies they’d like to see. They could also have a list of comedies that they are interested in watching.  The app allows the user to create as many lists as he or she would like providing the ability to uniquely name each of the lists he or she creates. After one or more lists are created, the user would be able to add movies to lists, delete movies from lists, and mark movies on the lists as watched by rating movies on the list.

Features Implemented
- Ability to list all “Movies to Watch” lists
- Ability to create and unlimited number of “Movies to Watch” lists each with a unique name
- Ability to list all movies in a “Movies to Watch” list when it is clicked on.
- Ability to add new movies to a “Movies to Watch” list.
- Ability to delete movies in a "Movies to Watch" list.
- Lists should get saved to a database and loaded and retrieve from that database each time the web application is visited.

Features Planned
- When adding a movie to a “Movies to Watch” list, the add feature should auto populate with movie names from an online movie names API.  This should work similar to how google predicts what you are looking for by the letter you have typed in.  You can begin auto-populating choices a user can select from after three letters are typed.
- Ability to edit movies in a “Movies to Watch” list.
- (Bonus Points – Not required) Ability to click on a movie name in a list that would open a trailer for the movie online or take you to a rating page for the movie online.
