# MovieListApp
A web application that allows you to create lists of movies you’d like to watch.  A person using your app may create a “Horror Movies” list that contains all the horror movies they’d like to see. They could also have a list of comedies that are interested in watching.  The app would allow the user to create as many lists as he or she would like providing them with the ability to uniquely name each of the lists he or she creates. After one or more lists are created, the user would be able to add movies to lists, delete movies from lists, and mark movies on the lists as watched by rating movies on the list
